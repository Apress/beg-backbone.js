# Chapter 12: Creating a Manageable JavaScript Codebase 

This chapter includes two main directories 

* requirejs : an illustration of how RequireJS can be used in isolation 
* twitter: an example of how RequireJS can be used to construct a Backbone application (the Twitter example)

Note that the server from Chapter 6 must be listening in order for this code to execute correctly.
