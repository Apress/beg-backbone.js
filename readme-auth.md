# Beginning Backbone.js Apress : Code Samples 

The following repository contains code samples for each chapter from my book on Backbone, [Beginning Backbone.js](http://www.apress.com/9781430263340), published by Apress. 

Server files are written for Node.js, while all HTML and JavaScript should be served properly using a HTTP server, rather than opening as files. 

Don't forget, each snippet will make a lot more sense with the book!
