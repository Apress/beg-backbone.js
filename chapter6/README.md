# Chapter 6: From Start to Finish: A Complete App Example 

There are two parts to this application. Note that this same server is used across subsequent examples in the book.

## Client 
This is the client code for the application. It includes two HTML files:  

* stage1.html, an incomplete HTML file to give you a start with this chapter  
*index.html, the final copy of the code,

## Server 
Another node.js server. Note that you will need to generate your own keys to have this code execute properly. This can be done by accessing the [Twitter Developer page](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) and creating a new application. 

You'll also need to ensure you have the twit library installed using npm (instructions in the server Readme.md file)
