# Chapter 3: Backbone Models and Collections 

## Client

All code is inline JavaScript within client/index.html. Comment out what you don't need as you go along and test this out on your browser. Use Chrome Developer Tools to help you along with debugging and interacting with the code. The contents of this folder should be served using an Apache server (install XAMPP if you want to get an easy start)


## Server
You'll need to install node.js to have this server run properly. Simply execute `node server.js ` from the command line to get the server going. Make sure you have installed the express package via npm `npm install -g express`.
